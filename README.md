🦠 Detection_COVID_19
Multi-Class Classification for Chest X-Ray Images
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model to classify Chest X-Ray images into three categories:

COVID-19

Pneumonia

No Disease (Normal)

Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model learns to extract patterns and features from chest X-ray scans to accurately detect and categorize respiratory conditions.

📂 Dataset & Preprocessing
✅ Preprocessing Steps:
All X-ray images are converted to RGB format.

Each image is resized to 128×128 pixels for consistency.

Separate folders are used to organize images by class (COVID, Pneumonia, Normal).

The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets using train_test_split.

Pixel normalization is performed to scale the values between 0 and 1.

DataLoader functionality (or Keras ImageDataGenerator) is used for efficient batch processing and augmentation (if applicable).

🏗️ Model Architecture
The model is built using the Keras Sequential API with the following structure:

Input Layer: Accepts 128×128×3 input images.

Convolutional Layers: Multiple Conv2D layers for feature extraction.

Activation Function: ReLU for hidden layers.

Pooling Layers: MaxPooling2D layers to down-sample feature maps.

Flatten Layer: Converts 2D feature maps into 1D vector.

Fully Connected Layers: Dense layers for decision making.

Dropout Layers: Added to prevent overfitting.

Output Layer: A Dense layer with Softmax activation for multi-class classification.

🏋️‍♂️ Training Process
The model is trained for 150 epochs using the Adam optimizer.

Categorical Crossentropy is used as the loss function.

Batch size, learning rate, and other hyperparameters are fine-tuned for best performance.

Dropout and EarlyStopping are implemented to avoid overfitting and improve generalization.

📊 Evaluation Metrics
Model performance is measured using the following metrics:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Precision

Recall

These metrics are evaluated on both validation and test datasets to assess the model's effectiveness and robustness.

⚠️ Challenges Faced
Hyperparameter Tuning: Required multiple iterations to optimize learning rate, batch size, etc.

Overfitting: Initially observed overfitting on the training set; mitigated using dropout and early stopping.

Class Imbalance: Ensured balanced dataset splits or used class weighting techniques (if needed).

✅ Results
The final model demonstrates:

High accuracy on both training and validation sets.

Strong generalization across unseen test data.

Clear distinction between COVID, Pneumonia, and Normal cases using learned features.
